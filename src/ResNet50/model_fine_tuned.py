'''In this section we use transfer learning with a pretrained ResNet50 model. 
Transfer learning is a machine learning technique where a pretrained model is taken (usually trained on a big task) 
and then reused for a different but related task. 
This technique is really convenient because 
training a deep learning model from scratch requires a lot of data 
and takes a long time and lots of computing power. 
With transfer learning, however, we can save resources and get better performance 
even with small datasets. [explain better in the report and cite]

'''general steps:
1. Use transfer learning with a pretrained ResNet50 model.
2. Replace its final classification layer to match your classes.
3. Fine-tune the model on your training images.
4. Save the model.
5. Remove the classification head so you can use it to extract features for your image retrieval pipeline.
