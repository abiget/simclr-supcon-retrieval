# Image Retrieval with SimCLR and Supervised Contrastive Learning

## Project Overview
This project implements an image retrieval system that combines SimCLR pre-trained weights with Supervised Contrastive Learning (SupCon). The system finds visually and semantically similar images to a given query image by leveraging powerful representations that group similar images together in the embedding space.

## Features
- Uses a ResNet50 backbone with pre-trained SimCLR weights (converted from TensorFlow)
- Fine-tunes the model with Supervised Contrastive Loss for better feature learning
- Provides tools for computing similarity between images
- Includes visualization of similar images
- Evaluates performance using top-k retrieval accuracy
- Creates submission files in the required JSON format for API integration

## How it Works
1. **Feature Learning Pipeline**:
   - Start with ResNet50 pre-trained on SimCLR (self-supervised learning)
   - Fine-tune with Supervised Contrastive Loss using labeled data
   - Use the learned embeddings for image retrieval tasks

2. **Image Retrieval Process**:
   - Extract feature embeddings using the fine-tuned model
   - Compute cosine similarity with all images in the dataset
   - Return the most similar images based on similarity scores

3. **Evaluation**: The system evaluates retrieval performance using top-k accuracy, measuring how often the retrieved images belong to the same class as the query image.

## Requirements
- Python 3.7+
- PyTorch 1.7+
- torchvision
- Pillow
- numpy
- matplotlib
- tqdm
- wandb (for experiment tracking)

## Model Architecture
- **Backbone**: ResNet50 pre-trained with SimCLR (self-supervised learning)
- **Projection Head**: MLP with structure [2048 → 512 → 128]
- **Training**: Supervised Contrastive Loss with temperature parameter
